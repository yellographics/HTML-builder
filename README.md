# Tasks to understand a work with NODE.JS (fs, path modules, promises)

The block consists of five small tasks with increasing complexity and a final task. The tasks focus on learning specific topics such as working with files, streams, events, paths and directories. The final task involves using the skills learned earlier to create a small console utility that allows you to assemble a static site from HTML components and style files.

Each folder contains README file with task description.
